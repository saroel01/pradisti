- **Epic Management:** `/pm:epic-decompose`, `/pm:epic-sync`, `/pm:epic-oneshot`, `/pm:epic-show`, `/pm:epic-close`
- **Issue Operations:** `/pm:issue-start`, `/pm:issue-sync`, `/pm:issue-show`, `/pm:issue-status`, `/pm:issue-close`
- **Workflow Control:** `/pm:next`, `/pm:status`, `/pm:standup`, `/pm:blocked`, `/pm:in-progress`

#### Context & Testing
- **Context Management:** `/context:create`, `/context:update`, `/context:prime`
- **Testing Framework:** `/testing:prime`, `/testing:run`
- **Utility Operations:** `/pm:init`, `/pm:validate`, `/pm:clean`, `/pm:search`

### Specialized Agent System

#### Available Agents
1. **code-analyzer** - Multi-file code analysis, bug hunting, logic tracing
2. **file-analyzer** - Large file summarization, content extraction
3. **test-runner** - Test execution with comprehensive result analysis
4. **parallel-worker** - Multi-agent coordination for parallel execution

#### Agent Capabilities
- **Context Preservation:** Heavy processing isolated from main conversation
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple agents executing simultaneously  
- **Specialized Analysis:** Domain-specific processing (code, files, tests)
- **Summary Reporting:** Concise results preserving main thread context

### GitHub Integration Features

#### Issue Management
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Parent-child issue relationships via gh-sub-issue
- **Automated Sync:** Local epic/task state synchronized with GitHub Issues
- **Progress Tracking:** Issue comments provide detailed audit trail
- **Label Management:** Automated tagging with epic:feature, task:feature patterns

#### Team Collaboration
- **Transparent Progress:** All AI work visible through GitHub Issues
- **Code Review Integration:** AI-generated code follows standard PR process
- **Multi-Instance Coordination:** Multiple Claude instances share project state
- **Human-AI Handoffs:** Seamless transitions with preserved context

## Current System State

### Infrastructure Status
- ✅ **GitHub CLI Integration:** Version 2.78.0 with gh-sub-issue extension
- ✅ **Command System:** 40+ commands across PM, context, and testing domains
- ✅ **Agent Framework:** 4 specialized agents operational
- ✅ **Context System:** 9 comprehensive context files created
- ✅ **Rule System:** 9+ behavior and operation rules defined

### Feature Completeness
- ✅ **Full PM Workflow:** PRD → Epic → Tasks → Implementation → Tracking
- ✅ **Parallel Execution:** Multi-agent coordination with worktree isolation
- ✅ **GitHub Synchronization:** Bidirectional sync between local and remote state
- ✅ **Context Management:** Persistent state across sessions and instances
- ✅ **Quality Assurance:** Spec-driven development with complete traceability

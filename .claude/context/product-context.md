# Product Context

## Target Users

### Primary User: Solo Developer with Claude Code
- **Profile:** Individual developer using Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- **Pain Points:** 
  - Context loss between sessions
  - Serial task execution limitations
  - Lack of structured project management
  - "Vibe coding" without specifications
- **Goals:** Structured, scalable development workflow with AI assistance

### Secondary User: Development Teams
- **Profile:** Teams integrating AI assistance into collaborative workflows
- **Pain Points:**
  - AI work isolated from team visibility
  - Difficulty coordinating human-AI handoffs
  - No audit trail for AI-generated code
  - Multiple developers blocking on same codebase
- **Goals:** Transparent AI collaboration, parallel development, team coordination

### Tertiary User: Project Managers & Stakeholders
- **Profile:** Non-technical stakeholders needing development visibility
- **Pain Points:**
  - Black box development processes
  - Unclear progress tracking
  - Difficulty understanding AI contribution
  - No clear requirements traceability
- **Goals:** Transparent progress, clear deliverables, risk visibility

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Spec-Driven Feature Development
**Scenario:** Developer needs to implement a complex feature with AI assistance
```
User Journey:
1. Create comprehensive PRD through guided brainstorming (/pm:prd-new)
2. Transform PRD into technical implementation plan (/pm:prd-parse)
3. Break implementation into parallel tasks (/pm:epic-decompose)
4. Sync to GitHub for team visibility (/pm:epic-sync)
5. Execute tasks with specialized agents (/pm:issue-start)
6. Track progress and completion (/pm:status)
```

### 2. Team Collaboration with AI
**Scenario:** Multiple developers and AI agents working on same project
```
User Journey:
1. Team lead creates epic and assigns issues
2. Human developer starts Issue A, AI agent starts Issue B
3. Progress visible to all team members through GitHub Issues
4. Seamless handoffs when human/AI completes their portion
5. Code review through standard GitHub PR process
6. Integration through coordinated merge process
```

### 3. Context Preservation Across Sessions
**Scenario:** Developer returns to project after days/weeks away
```
User Journey:
1. Load project context (/context:prime)
2. Check project status (/pm:status)
3. Get next priority task (/pm:next)
4. Resume work with full context intact
5. Update progress without losing state
```

## Product Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Epic & Task Management
- **PRD Creation:** Guided brainstorming for comprehensive product requirements
- **Technical Planning:** Transform business requirements into implementation plans
- **Task Decomposition:** Break complex work into actionable, parallelizable tasks
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time status updates and completion monitoring

#### GitHub Integration
- **Issue Synchronization:** Bidirectional sync between local state and GitHub Issues
- **Parent-Child Relationships:** Hierarchical task organization with automatic progress tracking
- **Team Visibility:** All work visible through GitHub Issues and comments
- **Audit Trail:** Complete traceability from requirement to implementation

#### AI Agent Coordination
- **Specialized Agents:** Different agents for different types of work (code, tests, analysis)
- **Context Preservation:** Heavy processing isolated from main conversation
- **Parallel Execution:** Multiple agents working simultaneously without interference
- **Summary Reporting:** Concise status updates from complex operations

#### Context Management
- **Session Persistence:** Project state preserved across conversations
- **Context Loading:** Quick restoration of project awareness
- **Context Updates:** Incremental refresh of project state
- **Multi-Instance Coordination:** Multiple Claude instances sharing project context

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **Fast Command Response:** Sub-second response for status/query commands
- **Scalable Parallel Execution:** Support 5-8+ simultaneous work streams
- **Efficient Context Usage:** Agents prevent context window exhaustion
- **Responsive GitHub Sync:** Batch operations to respect API limits

#### Reliability  
- **Atomic Operations:** Commands complete fully or fail cleanly
- **State Recovery:** System recovers gracefully from interruptions
- **Fail-Fast Validation:** Clear error messages for invalid operations
- **Data Consistency:** Local and remote state stay synchronized

#### Usability
- **Self-Documenting Commands:** Help text integrated into command structure
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple commands for beginners, advanced for power users
- **Clear Status Reporting:** Always know what the system is doing
- **Intuitive Workflows:** Natural progression from idea to implementation

#### Maintainability
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easy to add new commands, agents, rules
- **Version-Controlled Configuration:** All system behavior tracked in Git
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Commands, agents, rules, context clearly organized
- **Documentation-Driven:** System behavior documented in accessible format

## Success Criteria

### User Productivity Metrics
- **Context Switch Reduction:** 80%+ reduction in time lost switching between tasks
- **Parallel Task Increase:** 5-8x more simultaneous work streams vs. traditional development
- **Bug Rate Reduction:** 75%+ fewer bugs through spec-driven development
- **Feature Delivery Speed:** 2-3x faster feature completion through parallelization

### Collaboration Metrics
- **Team Visibility:** 100% of AI work visible to team through GitHub
- **Handoff Efficiency:** Seamless human-AI transitions with no context loss  
- **Review Process:** AI-generated code follows same review process as human code
- **Documentation Quality:** Complete traceability from requirement to implementation

### System Adoption Metrics
- **Command Usage:** Regular use of 10+ core PM commands

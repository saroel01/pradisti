# Project Brief

## What It Does

Claude Code PM is a comprehensive project management system that transforms spec-driven development into production code through GitHub Issues integration and parallel AI agent execution. It provides a battle-tested workflow that turns Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into epics, epics into GitHub issues, and issues into production code â€“ with full traceability at every step.

## Why It Exists

### The Problem
Every development team struggles with the same fundamental issues:
- **Context evaporates** between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery of project state
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple developers touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specifications  
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end, creating coordination problems
- **AI-assisted development becomes a silo** isolated from team collaboration

### The Solution
Claude Code PM solves these problems through a systematic approach:
- **Persistent context** preserved across all development sessions
- **Parallel agents** executing multiple work streams simultaneously
- **Spec-driven development** with complete requirement traceability
- **GitHub-native collaboration** making AI work visible to entire team
- **Intelligent prioritization** with automatic next-action recommendations

## Project Scope

### Core Objectives
1. **Eliminate Context Loss** - Maintain complete project state across sessions
2. **Enable Parallel Development** - Support 5-8+ simultaneous work streams
3. **Enforce Spec-Driven Development** - No "vibe coding" allowed
4. **Integrate Team Collaboration** - AI work visible through GitHub Issues
5. **Maintain Complete Traceability** - Every line of code traces to specification

### Success Criteria
- **89% reduction** in time lost to context switching
- **5-8x increase** in parallel task execution  
- **75% reduction** in bug rates through specification adherence
- **2-3x faster** feature delivery through parallelization

### Out of Scope
- Direct IDE integration (uses Claude Code as interface)
- Custom GitHub Projects UI (leverages existing GitHub infrastructure) 
- Real-time collaboration features (async coordination through Issues)
- External tool integrations beyond GitHub CLI

## Key Features

### 1. 5-Phase Development Discipline
```
Brainstorm â†’ Document â†’ Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Track
```
- **Phase 1:** Comprehensive PRD creation through guided brainstorming
- **Phase 2:** Technical implementation planning with architectural decisions
- **Phase 3:** Task decomposition into parallelizable work items
- **Phase 4:** Multi-agent execution with progress tracking
- **Phase 5:** Transparent status reporting and completion validation

### 2. Specialized AI Agents
- **code-analyzer:** Multi-file code analysis and bug detection
- **file-analyzer:** Large content summarization for context preservation  
- **test-runner:** Comprehensive test execution and failure analysis
- **parallel-worker:** Coordinated multi-agent task execution

### 3. GitHub Integration
- Issues as single source of truth for project state
- Parent-child issue relationships for hierarchical organization
- Progress updates through issue comments  
- Team collaboration through existing GitHub workflows

### 4. Context Management System
- Persistent project context across conversations
- Efficient context loading and incremental updates
- Context isolation for complex operations
- Multi-instance coordination for team development

## Target Outcomes

### For Individual Developers
- **Never lose context** between development sessions
- **Work on multiple tasks simultaneously** through agent coordination
- **Follow disciplined development process** eliminating "vibe coding"
- **Maintain complete audit trail** from idea to implementation

### For Development Teams  
- **AI work visible to entire team** through GitHub Issues
- **Seamless human-AI handoffs** with preserved context
- **Parallel development without conflicts** through worktree isolation
- **Standard code review process** for all work including AI-generated

### For Project Stakeholders
- **Transparent progress tracking** through GitHub dashboard
- **Complete requirement traceability** from PRD to production
- **Clear deliverable definitions** with acceptance criteria
- **Predictable development velocity** through systematic approach

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- âœ… Core command structure implemented
- âœ… Basic GitHub integration established  
- âœ… Agent coordination system operational
- âœ… Context management system functional

### Phase 2: Workflow Optimization (In Progress)
- ðŸ”„ Context creation and documentation
- ðŸ“‹ PRD-to-production workflow testing
- ðŸ“‹ Team collaboration pattern validation
- ðŸ“‹ Performance optimization for large projects

### Phase 3: Scale & Polish (Future)
- ðŸ“‹ Multi-team coordination features
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced reporting and analytics
- ðŸ“‹ Integration with additional development tools
- ðŸ“‹ Enterprise deployment patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GitHub API rate limits:** Batched operations and local caching
- **Git merge conflicts:** Worktree isolation and coordination protocols
- **Context window exhaustion:** Agent-based context preservation
- **System complexity:** Progressive disclosure and clear documentation

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning curve:** Comprehensive documentation and guided workflows
- **Team resistance:** Gradual adoption with immediate value demonstration
- **Tool integration:** GitHub-native approach leveraging existing workflows
- **Maintenance overhead:** Self-documenting system with version-controlled configuration

## Competitive Advantage

### Unique Value Proposition
- **Only system designed specifically for AI-assisted team development**
- **Complete integration of specification, execution, and collaboration**
- **Unprecedented parallel development capability through agent coordination**
- **GitHub-native architecture leveraging existing team infrastructure**

### Moat Elements
- **Systematic approach** difficult to replicate without complete system
- **Agent coordination patterns** require deep understanding of context management
- **GitHub integration depth** builds on existing team workflows and data
- **Proven results** from real project usage demonstrating measurable benefits

This project represents a fundamental shift in how teams approach AI-assisted development, moving from ad-hoc collaboration to systematic, scalable, and transparent workflows.

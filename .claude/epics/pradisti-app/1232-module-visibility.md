# Dynamic Module Visibility & Access Control

## Description

Implement a sophisticated dynamic module loading system with database-driven visibility and access control. This system will allow administrators to control which modules are available to different user types and enable progressive feature rollout based on user roles and permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database schema for module visibility and access control created
- [ ] Dynamic module loading system implemented in SvelteKit
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) system functional
- [ ] Admin interface for managing module visibility
- [ ] Module access guards working on all protected routes

## Technical Details

### Module Management System
- Create database tables for modules, roles, and permissions
- Implement module registry system with metadata
- Design flexible permission matrix for different access levels
- Create module loading service with lazy loading capabilities

### Access Control Implementation
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Create middleware for checking module access permissions
- Design hierarchical permission system (view, edit, admin)
- Implement user role assignment and management

### Dynamic Loading Architecture
- Create module wrapper components for conditional rendering
- Implement route-level access guards
- Design progressive loading for large modules
- Set up module dependency resolution system

### Admin Interface
- Build admin dashboard for module management
- Create interface for role and permission assignment
- Implement module visibility toggles
- Design user role management interface

## Dependencies

- **Task 1231**: Requires SvelteKit foundation and authentication system

## Effort Estimate

**L (Large): 3-4 days**

- Day 1: Database schema design and RBAC system setup
- Day 2: Dynamic module loading implementation
- Day 3: Access control guards and middleware
- Day 4: Admin interface and permission management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Module visibility can be controlled via database configuration
- [ ] Users see only modules they have access to
- [ ] Role-based permissions work correctly across all routes
- [ ] Admin can assign/revoke module access without code changes
- [ ] Module loading is performant and doesn't block the UI
- [ ] Access denied scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] System supports hierarchical permissions (view < edit < admin)
- [ ] Module metadata is properly stored and retrievable
- [ ] All access control decisions are logged for audit purposes

# SvelteKit Foundation & Authentication Setup

## Description

Set up the foundational SvelteKit 2.0+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and implement Lucia v3 authentication system. This establishes the core architecture for the PRADISTI application with modern tooling and secure authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SvelteKit 2.0+ project initialized with TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI integrated and functional
- [ ] Lucia v3 authentication system implemented with session management
- [ ] Basic user registration and login flows working
- [ ] Protected routes and authentication guards established

## Technical Details

### Core Stack Setup
- Initialize SvelteKit project with TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI component library
- Set up build tools and development environment
- Implement proper TypeScript configuration

### Authentication Implementation
- Integrate Lucia v3 for session-based authentication
- Set up user authentication database tables
- Implement registration, login, and logout endpoints
- Create authentication middleware and route guards
- Design responsive authentication UI components

### Project Structure
- Establish standard SvelteKit project organization
- Set up proper routing structure
- Configure environment variables and secrets
- Implement error handling and validation patterns

## Dependencies

This is a foundation task with no dependencies on other tasks.

## Effort Estimate

**L (Large): 3-4 days**

- Day 1: SvelteKit setup, TypeScript configuration, Tailwind/DaisyUI integration
- Day 2: Lucia v3 authentication setup and database configuration
- Day 3: Authentication flows implementation (register, login, logout)
- Day 4: Route guards, session management, and UI polishing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SvelteKit application runs successfully in development mode
- [ ] All dependencies installed and configured correctly
- [ ] Authentication system allows user registration and login
- [ ] Session management works across page refreshes
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] Authentication UI is responsive and follows DaisyUI patterns
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Basic error handling implemented
- [ ] Development environment documented

# MariaDB Schema & 21-Component Student Model

## Description

Design and implement the complete database schema with the comprehensive 21-component student model for PRADISTI. This includes Prisma ORM setup, progressive data entry system, and all supporting database structures for the educational management platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MariaDB database configured and connected to SvelteKit application
- [ ] Prisma ORM setup with all 21 student model components
- [ ] Progressive data entry system for student information
- [ ] Database migration system established
- [ ] Student data validation and integrity constraints implemented

## Technical Details

### Database Setup
- Configure MariaDB connection and credentials
- Set up Prisma ORM with MariaDB provider
- Design database migration strategy
- Implement connection pooling and optimization

### 21-Component Student Model
Based on the technical specifications, implement these student data components:
1. Basic Information (name, ID, contact details)
2. Academic Records (grades, subjects, assessments)
3. Attendance Tracking (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)
4. Behavioral Assessment (conduct, participation, social skills)
5. Learning Progress (skills development, milestones)
6. Health Records (medical info, allergies, emergencies)
7. Family Information (parents, guardians, contacts)
8. Financial Records (fees, payments, scholarships)
9. Extracurricular Activities (clubs, sports, achievements)
10. Special Needs (accommodations, support requirements)
11. Career Guidance (interests, aptitude, counseling)
12. Academic Planning (course selection, scheduling)
13. Communication Logs (parent meetings, notes)
14. Disciplinary Records (incidents, interventions)
15. Assessment Portfolio (projects, assignments, rubrics)
16. Learning Style Preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
17. Goal Setting and Tracking (personal, academic goals)
18. Peer Relationships (social dynamics, group work)
19. Technology Usage (digital literacy, online safety)
20. Cultural and Language Background
21. Future Planning (college prep, career readiness)

### Progressive Data Entry System
- Design multi-step form wizard for student registration
- Implement data validation at each step
- Create save-and-continue functionality
- Build data completeness indicators and progress tracking

### Supporting Database Structures
- User management (teachers, admins, parents)
- School organizational structure (classes, subjects, departments)
- Academic calendar and scheduling
- Assessment and grading systems
- Communication and notification logs

## Dependencies

- **Task 1231**: Requires SvelteKit foundation and authentication system for database integration

## Effort Estimate

**L (Large): 3-4 days**

- Day 1: MariaDB setup, Prisma configuration, and basic schema design
- Day 2: Implement 21-component student model with relationships
- Day 3: Progressive data entry system and validation
- Day 4: Database optimization, migrations, and testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] MariaDB database is properly configured and accessible
- [ ] Prisma schema includes all 21 student model components
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Student data can be entered progressively without loss
- [ ] All data relationships and constraints work correctly
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid data entry
- [ ] Database queries are optimized for performance
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained across all operations
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are documented
- [ ] Student data export/import functionality works
- [ ] Database supports concurrent user access
- [ ] All sensitive data is properly secured and encrypted

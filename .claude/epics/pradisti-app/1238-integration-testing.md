# Cross-Module Integration & System Testing

## Description

Implement comprehensive cross-module integration to ensure seamless data sharing and workflow coordination between all PRADISTI modules. This task focuses on creating unified search capabilities, implementing performance optimizations, and conducting thorough system-wide testing to ensure the application functions as a cohesive whole.

This critical integration phase will establish the interconnections between Academic, Student, HR, Asset Management, and Financial modules, enabling efficient data flow and unified reporting across the entire educational management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cross-module data sharing implemented with real-time synchronization
- [ ] Unified search functionality across all modules with advanced filtering
- [ ] System-wide performance optimization achieving target response times
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing suite covering all module interactions
- [ ] End-to-end testing scenarios validating complete user workflows

## Technical Details

### Integration Components:
- Event-driven architecture for real-time data synchronization
- Unified API gateway for consistent module communication
- Shared data models and cross-reference tables
- Global search indexing system with Elasticsearch integration
- Centralized caching strategy for improved performance

### Performance Optimizations:
- Database query optimization and indexing strategies
- API response caching and rate limiting
- Frontend lazy loading and code splitting
- Background job processing for heavy operations
- Resource monitoring and alerting systems

### Testing Framework:
- Integration test suite covering all module combinations
- End-to-end testing with automated user journey validation
- Performance testing with load simulation
- Security penetration testing across all endpoints
- Data consistency validation across modules

### Monitoring and Analytics:
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- User behavior analytics and usage patterns
- System health dashboards and alerting
- Error tracking and automated incident response

## Dependencies

**Hard Dependencies:**
- Task 1234: Academic Management Module (curriculum, grades, scheduling)
- Task 1235: Student Information System (enrollment, records, communication)
- Task 1236: HR Management Module (staff, payroll, performance)
- Task 1237: Asset Management & Financial Tracking Modules

**Technical Requirements:**
- All individual modules must be functionally complete
- Database schemas must be finalized and stable
- API endpoints must be documented and tested

## Effort Estimate

**Size: Large (L)**
- Estimated Duration: 3-4 days
- Complexity: High - requires deep understanding of all modules and their interactions
- Risk Level: High - critical path item that could impact overall system functionality

**Breakdown:**
- Cross-module integration development: 2 days
- Performance optimization and caching: 1 day
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixes: 1-2 days

## Definition of Done

# Asset Management & Financial Tracking Modules

## Description

Implement the Sarpras (Sarana Prasarana - asset inventory and maintenance) and Keuangan (financial tracking) modules for the PRADISTI application. These modules will provide comprehensive asset management capabilities and financial tracking functionality for the educational institution.

The Sarpras module will handle inventory management, asset tracking, maintenance scheduling, and condition monitoring. The Keuangan module will manage income/expense tracking, budget planning, and financial reporting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sarpras module implements complete asset inventory management with categories, locations, and status tracking
- [ ] Asset maintenance scheduling system with automated reminders and work order management
- [ ] Keuangan module provides comprehensive income and expense tracking with categorization
- [ ] Budget planning and monitoring functionality with variance reporting
- [ ] Integration with existing user management and audit logging systems

## Technical Details

### Sarpras Module Components:
- Asset registry with detailed specifications and documentation
- Location and category management system
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking workflows
- Condition assessment and depreciation calculations
- Asset transfer and disposal processes

### Keuangan Module Components:
- Chart of accounts configuration
- Transaction recording and categorization
- Budget creation and monitoring tools
- Financial reporting and analytics
- Integration with existing approval workflows

### Database Requirements:
- Asset tables with relationships to locations and categories
- Maintenance history and scheduling tables
- Financial transaction and budget tables
- Audit trails for all financial operations

### Technical Considerations:
- File attachment support for asset documentation and receipts
- Barcode/QR code integration for asset tracking
- Automated backup for financial data integrity
- Role-based access control for sensitive financial information
